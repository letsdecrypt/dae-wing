| [Docker](https://www.docker.com) | Latest  | Optional |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/letsdecrypt/dae-wing
cd dae-wing
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Run Locally

**API Only Mode** (for development):

```bash
make deps
go run . run -c ./ --api-only
```

**Full Mode** (with dae proxy):

```bash
make deps
go run -exec sudo . run
```

### Run with Docker

Pull the prebuilt image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/daeuniverse/dae-wing
```

Or build from source:

```bash
# Using Docker Compose (recommended)
docker compose up -d

# Or using Docker CLI
docker build -t dae-wing .
docker run -d \
    --privileged \
    --network=host \
    --pid=host \
    --restart=always \
    -v /sys:/sys \
    -v /etc/dae-wing:/etc/dae-wing \
    --name=dae-wing \
    dae-wing
```

## 📖 API Documentation

dae-wing uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) for its API.

### Export Schema

```bash
go build -o dae-wing
./dae-wing export schema > schema.graphql
```

### GraphQL Playground

Use [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground) for interactive API exploration:

1. Open GraphQL Playground
2. Set endpoint to `http://localhost:2023/graphql`
3. Explore the schema and test queries

### Export Config Outline

```bash
./dae-wing export outline > outline.json
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Use [dae-outline2config](https://github.com/daeuniverse/dae-outline2config) to convert outlines to dae config format.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Config

Configs include `global`, `dns`, and `routing` sections from [dae](https://github.com/daeuniverse/dae).

- **Multiple Configs** — Switch between different configurations
- **Shared Resources** — Nodes, subscriptions, and groups are shared across configs
- **Hot Reload** — Selecting a new config automatically reloads dae

### Subscription

A subscription contains:

- Source link (URL)
- Collection of resolved nodes

### Node

Nodes represent proxy profiles imported via links. They can exist:

- Independently (manually added)
- Within subscriptions (auto-imported)

> ⚠️ Nodes are deduplicated by link within the same collection.

### Group

Groups serve as routing outbounds with:

- A collection of subscriptions and nodes
- Node selection policy for connections
- Preserved nodes during subscription updates
